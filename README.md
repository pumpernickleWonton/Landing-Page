# Landing-Page
The Odin Project derived assignment to create a website landing page using dummy-text and images.

Started 4/17/2023 

Hopefully this project won't take me incredibly long. It doesn't seem overly complicated at first glance but I'm sure that's deceptive. All aspects of HTML and CSS that I've learned about thusfar will likely need to be integrated, along with some things that have not yet been explicitly taught. Hopefully my prior understanding before starting TOP will be sufficient to alleviate any confusion this may cause me.

(The above text doesn't say anything at all, really. I just wanted filler text for the README file)

COMMIT LOG: 

1. Blank slate file structure with minimal CSS
2. Basic HTML structure with (most) font stylings
